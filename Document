# URL Shortening Service

## Overview
This documentation outlines the architecture and functionalities of a URL Shortening Service implemented using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Redis. The service allows users to shorten URLs and track analytics for shortened URLs.

## Files Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

1. **index.js**: Entry point of the application. Defines server configuration, routes, and middleware.
2. **models/url.js**: Defines the MongoDB schema for storing URL data and handles URL expiration.
3. **models/user.js**: Defines the MongoDB schema for storing user data and provides methods for user-related operations.
4. **routes/url.js, routes/user.js, routes/analytics.js**: Route handlers for URL shortening, user authentication, and analytics.
5. **controllers/url.js, controllers/user.js**: Controller functions implementing business logic for URL shortening, analytics, user signup, and signin.
6. **middleware/verifyToken.js**: Middleware function to verify JWT tokens for authentication.
